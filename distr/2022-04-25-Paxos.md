Paxos is a protocol for (deterministic) state machine replication in an asynchronous environment, in which there are no bounds on timing, that admits crash failures (i.e., a machine makes no more transitions).

Messaging between correct processes is reliable (but not necessarily FIFO).

Reconfigurable version (i.e., a crashed process can be replaced by a fresh one)
of the multidecree Paxos protocol.

A client sends a command <k, cid, op>, where
k is the identifier of the client that issued the command
cid is a client-local unique command identifier (e.g., a sequence number)
so that there cannot be two commands with the same k and cid but have different operations

Replica:
f+1 to tolerate f crashes

Leader:
f+1 to tolerate f crashes

Acceptor:
2f+1 to tolerate f crashes

A client broadcasts <request, c>, where c is a command, to all replicas and waits for <response, cid, result> from one of the replicas.
